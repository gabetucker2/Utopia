# Utopia
Hi there!  This is the script repository for my Unity3D-based hexagonal procedural terrain generator.

There are some other systems (e.g., navigation, maps, spawning NPC's) that are partially implemented, but these are not the focal point of this project.

The `MapGenerator.cs` script in `Scripts` > `Core` is the script that procedurally generates the map.  I will soon add some instructions to use this system yourself.

To see me using the system, feel free to visit `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URtMGv3V0oo`!
